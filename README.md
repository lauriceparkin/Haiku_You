As I write this in April, 2020 in Brooklyn, NY, most of the planet is on lockdown inside their homes in an attempt to avoid infection by the Covid-19 virus. While being stuck inside can be challenging, it can also be a great time for creativity and self-reflection. 

Writing haiku is a fun,creative activity that anyone can enjoy. This project will allow users to learn more about Haiku, see examples, and have the opportunity to write and share their own. By registering on the site, they will be able to save their Haikus, as well as see the work of others. 

It was built with Ruby on Rails on the backend and React on the front. Auth is implemented with BCrypt.
