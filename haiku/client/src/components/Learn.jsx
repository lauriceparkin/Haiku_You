Does it have to be about something specific?<br />


<h4>Can I see some examples?</h4><br />


So, wait, whatâ€™s the purpose of this site?<br />

For people to not only learn more about haiku and share their work with others.

Will writing haiku really help me find my zen?<br /> <br />

Not scientifically proven, but definitely maybe.</div>
