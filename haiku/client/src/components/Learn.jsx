            In the twilight rain, these brilliant-hued hibiscus, A lovely sunset.
            An old silent pond, A frog jumps into the pond, Splash! Silence again.<br />
            <br />

            <h4>Oh, I get it, it's all about nature.</h4><br />
            Not at all, they can be about anything you like. Food's a fun topic:
            Electric salsa, Glides across beans, rice and meat, Dancing palate joy.<br />
            Here's one about food and nature:<br />
            Like crunchy cornflakes, Gold leaves rustle underfoot, Beauty in decay.<br />
            <br />
